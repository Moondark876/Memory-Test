# Memory Test

This is a small game made in pygame called Memory Test. It is inspired by the human benchmarking game called Verbal Memory. It is not complete yet, but it is in a runnable state.

# Problems

The game currently has no executable file. It is not possible to run it on devices without python installed. If you know the pyinstaller command to properly compile the game into an executable, make a pull request to add it. Thank you.
